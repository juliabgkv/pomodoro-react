# Pomodoro App

This is a simple Pomodo Timer app that will help you to focus on your task. You can:
1) Switch timer on three different modes: pomodori(work), short break and long break.
2) Set your custom time for each timer.
3) When the time is done you will hear a sound notification.


## Idea

The original Pomodoro technique has six steps (taken from Wikipedia):

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
6. After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
